        <h1>Duck with Oranges</h1>
        <img src="../img/duck.jpg" alt="picture of duck in oranges">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As in the title, the dish is composed of two parts: a crispy duck staked in the oven to golden brown colour, and the sweet and sour, orange flavoured sauce. The duck needs generous seasoning with salt and pepper. One can brush it with orange zest a bit, fill it with a bunch of garlic, a sprig of thyme, an orange cut in two. It should sit in the oven at least 1.5 hours (twenty minutes per pound of weight plus 15 minutes to start off) at 170-180<sup>o</sup>C. The sauce can be prepared separatedly if one has some dark stock (2 glasses), or together with roasting duck by laying it on a bed of chopped vegetables. Orange zest requires blanching in boiling water. Sweet and sour taste is achieved by combining the sause foundaton with gastrique - a mixture of red wine vinegar and sugar reduced to syrop. When completed successfully it is a feast for the eyes and taste buds!
