        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is another classic dish from French quisine. It is rich in both taste and calories, and for that reason may be served with just some vegetables like asparagus or Brussel sprouts. The preparation takes some time and planning. It is important to keep the beef fillet chilled to keep it in shape and have its outer layers stick closer to the meat. As for french pastry, one could make it or buy ready-made frozen sheets which can defrost in room temperature in less than 30 mins. A good gravy makes an essential accessory to beef Wellington. It is preferably based on madeira or red wine. And remember that Wellington needs resting about 10 minutes after being taken out from the oven.</p>
