        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is many`s favourite classic French dessert. It is based on vanilla custard with sugar crust. With few ingrediences it may seem simple to make, yet it may take several attempts to get consistency right.  At its best it should be elegant and velvety in structure, with a delicate hint of vanila. It is best complemented by a glass of cognac or Grand Marnier. The bast result can be achieved when using fresh free-range eggs.
